Michael Zhang: Hi there! I'm looking for some recommendations on sunscreen brands. Can you help me out?

Pharmacy Service: Hi Michael! Absolutely, I'd be happy to assist you. What specifically are you looking for in a sunscreen?

Michael Zhang: Well, I'm in need of a sunscreen that offers broad-spectrum protection and is suitable for sensitive skin. I also prefer something that's non-greasy and doesn't leave a white cast.

Pharmacy Service: Got it, thanks for letting me know. Have you tried any sunscreens in the past that met some of these criteria?

Michael Zhang: Yes, I've tried a few, but I haven't found one that ticks off all the boxes yet. Some were too heavy and caused breakouts, while others didn't provide adequate protection or felt uncomfortable on my skin.

Pharmacy Service: Understandable. Based on your needs, I'd recommend trying the La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Milk Sunscreen SPF 60. It offers broad-spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays, suitable for sensitive skin, and has a lightweight, non-greasy texture that absorbs quickly without leaving a white residue.

Michael Zhang: That sounds like exactly what I'm looking for! How often should I apply it, and can I use it under makeup?

Pharmacy Service: You should apply sunscreen generously at least 15 minutes before sun exposure and reapply every two hours, or more frequently if swimming or sweating. As for using it under makeup, yes, you can definitely apply makeup over the La Roche-Posay sunscreen once it's fully absorbed into your skin.

Michael Zhang: Great, thank you for the recommendation and advice! I'll give the La Roche-Posay sunscreen a try and let you know how it goes.

Pharmacy Service: You're welcome, Michael! If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out. I'm here to help.

Michael Zhang: Thanks again, I appreciate it!

Pharmacy Service: Anytime! Take care and enjoy the sun safely.
