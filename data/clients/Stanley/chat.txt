Stanley Yang: Hi there! I hope you're doing well. I'm in need of some advice on face washes for my combination skin. Can you help me out?

Pharmacy Service: Hi Stanley! Of course, I'd be happy to help. Can you tell me a bit more about your skin concerns and what you're looking for in a face wash?

Stanley Yang: Sure thing! I have combination skin, so it's oily in some areas like my T-zone but normal to dry in others. I also deal with occasional breakouts, especially around my chin and forehead. I'm looking for a face wash that can cleanse effectively without stripping my skin or causing more breakouts.

Pharmacy Service: Got it, thanks for sharing that info. Have you tried any specific products in the past that worked well or didn't work for you?

Stanley Yang: Yeah, I've tried a few different cleansers, but I haven't found the perfect match yet. Some were too harsh and drying, while others didn't do much for my breakouts.

Pharmacy Service: Understood. Based on your skin type and concerns, I'd recommend trying a gentle cleanser that's also formulated to target acne. One option you might consider is the Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser for Normal to Oily Skin. It's gentle enough not to over-dry your skin but effective in removing excess oil and impurities. Plus, it contains ingredients like zinc to help with acne.

Stanley Yang: That sounds promising! I've heard good things about Cetaphil. How should I incorporate it into my skincare routine?

Pharmacy Service: You can use the Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser twice a day, morning and night. Start by wetting your face with lukewarm water, then apply a small amount of the cleanser and gently massage it onto your skin in circular motions. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry with a clean towel. Follow up with a moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated.

Stanley Yang: Thank you so much for the recommendation and guidance! I'll give the Cetaphil cleanser a try and let you know how it goes.

Pharmacy Service: You're welcome, Stanley! Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions or need further assistance. I'm here to help.

Stanley Yang: Will do. Thanks again!

Pharmacy Service: Anytime! Take care.
