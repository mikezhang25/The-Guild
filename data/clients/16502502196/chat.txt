Hi, I'm interested in purchasing moisturizer!
Additionally, I am interested in face masks and would love to learn more
That is great, is there a particular brand you are interested in?
Additionally do you have dry skin or oily skin?
Hi I have combination skin, which has made it difficult to find good brands
I've heard CereVe is good but want to explore more Korean brands as well
